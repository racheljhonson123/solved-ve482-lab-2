<h1>2         Working on a remote server</h1>

As system administrators seldom have a physical access to their servers they remotely connect using a tool called Secure SHell (SSH). It allows them to log into a remote server and launch a regular shell, while keeping all the network traffic encrypted.

<ul>

 <li>Setup an SSH server on Minix 3. From Linux (using ssh) or Windows (using Putty) log into Minix 3.</li>

</ul>

Note: the network need to be properly setup on the Virtual Machine (VM).

<ul>

 <li>What is the default SSH port? Change this port for port 2222. Log into Minix 3 using this new SSH server setup.</li>

 <li>List and explain the role of each the file in the $HOME/.ssh In $HOME/.ssh/config, create an entry for Minix 3.</li>

 <li>Briefly explain how key-only authentication works in SSH. Generate a key-pair on the host system and use it to log into Minix 3 without a password.</li>

 <li>On Canvas, submit your public key in a <em>separate file</em>. Name it “student-id.pub”, e.g. “5143709219.pub”. This public key will be used to grant you access to the VE482 course server. Note: always remember that the private keys should remain <em>private</em>, and as such should never be disclosed.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

 <li>Setup git on your computer, we will use it for the rest of the semester.</li>

 <li>Search the use of the following git commands:</li>

 <li>Setup your git repository on the VE482 server.</li>

<h1>4         Project 1: presentations (part 1)</h1>

To ensure a more synthesized support during project 1, presentations are split into two parts. Topics are available on Canvas and their selection is on a first come first served basis.

Please well prepare your presentation and ask questions on others’ research. This should greatly help in the development of your mumsh. Be careful, mum might be listening!
